1. Project Overview
In this mini project, I have designed, developed and deployed a basic ecommerce web application implementing DevSecOps practices on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

I have built a 5-page mini e-commerce site with a test payment gateway in Stripe test mode, deployed it on Google Cloud, and integrated a secure CI/CD pipeline with vulnerability scanning, secret management, and logging.
